# Line Follower

This is a project that demonstrates how to create a line-following robot using 3 analog IR sensors, a MAKER-PI-RP2040 board, CircuitPython, and a PID algorithm.

## Used:
- MAKER-PI-RP2040 board
- CircuitPython
- 3x analog IR sensors
- 2x Motors
- 4xAA Batteries
- 2x Wheels
- Chassis (I used the hard cover of an old book)

## Functionality
The robot follows a black line on a white surface. The IR sensors detect the line and send signals to the board. The PID algorithm processes the signals and controls the motors to keep the robot centered on the line.

This project was for a semester course in my university.
